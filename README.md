## ☕ JAVA Programming Language

In this Repository there is a small game project in which there is a use of `Random` function in JAVA Language.
In this Program I have used the characters `0`, `1`, `2` for representing the **Stone**, **Paper**, and **Scissor**, and the random variable is set from the computer system itself and will display its choice when the user enters his choice.

## 🐍 PYTHON Programming Language

Here I have used basics of **Python programming language** to develop the basic **rock-paper-scissor game** in Python.
Same for this.
